# Full-Stack Ecommerce Store

I have developed a full-stack eCommerce store by creating APIs using Laravel for the backend. These APIs are integrated into the frontend built with Next.js to deliver a seamless shopping experience. You can explore the frontend code of the project here: [Ecommerce Frontend](https://github.com/abubakarchaudhary731/Ecommerce-Frontend).
